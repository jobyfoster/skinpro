# SkinPro

## Introduction

SkinPro is a web application designed to personalize skincare routines for users. By signing up and completing a detailed survey, users receive AI-generated skincare routines tailored to their skin type and needs, for both morning and night. The application incentivizes users with points for following their routines and rewards consistent daily logins with streaks, enhancing user engagement and promoting healthy skin care habits.

## Features

- **Personalized Skincare Routines:** Receive morning and night skincare routines generated by AI, tailored to your unique skin needs.
- **User Rewards:** Earn points for completing skincare routines and maintain login streaks for additional rewards.
- **Survey-Based Customization:** Complete a survey upon signup to ensure your skincare routine matches your skin type and preferences.
- **Secure Authentication:** Utilize Spring Security for safe and secure user authentication and data protection.

## Installation

To set up SkinPro for development or deployment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jobyfoster/SkinPro.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd SkinPro
```
4. Configure the application with your database and API keys (refer to the Configuration section below).

## Usage

All you need to do is configure the project, and it's good to go. Users can sign up, complete their skincare survey, then they will receive their skincare routine in the dashboard.

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf
- OpenAI API Key

Ensure you have the above dependencies installed and configured properly to run SkinPro.

## Configuration

Before you can run SkinPro successfully, there are a couple of essential configuration steps you need to follow. These involve setting up environment variables for the OpenAI API and configuring your PostgreSQL database connection through the `application.properties` file.

### Setting up the OpenAI API Key

1. In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.
2. Open this `.env` file in a text editor of your choice.
3. Add the following line to the file, replacing `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

4. Save and close the `.env` file. The application will read this environment variable to authenticate with OpenAI's services.

### Configuring PostgreSQL Database Connection

1. Locate the `application.properties` file within the `src/main/resources` directory of your project.
2. Open the `application.properties` file in a text editor.
3. You will need to configure the database connection by setting the following properties. Replace `your_database_url`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with your actual PostgreSQL database details:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://your_database_url:5432/skinpro
spring.datasource.username=your_database_username
spring.datasource.password=your_database_password
```
4. Optionally, you can configure additional properties related to Hibernate and connection pooling in this file, depending on your requirements.

By completing these configuration steps, you ensure that SkinPro can communicate securely with the OpenAI API for generating skincare routines and connect to your PostgreSQL database for storing user data and application state.
